Q: Basic Authorization is easily handled in the main flow, without the need for an additional proxy.
Give one reason (there are many) OAuth tokens should not be granted in the main flow, assuming the user has sent in the 
correct credentials.

A: Basic is recommended when we have our own server working with our own application, 
but when we need to use some api(a external server), is recommended that we use Oauth because we do not have to send the 
password/login on every request. Once we get the authorization token from the server, we just need to use it, so it does not 
need to be on the main flow. With Oauth we can track/denied access just for one session that is showing a suspicious behavior.
